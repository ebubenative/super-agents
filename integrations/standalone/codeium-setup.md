# "Acting as the Developer agent, help me implement task [TASK_ID] from the generated task list"

# Track progress
sa task status --project=my-project
```

## Advanced Integration Techniques

### Custom Workflow Templates

#### Microservices Development Template
```
You are working with the Super Agents framework on a microservices project.

Context: [PROJECT_NAME] microservices architecture
Current Phase: [DEVELOPMENT_PHASE]
Service Focus: [SERVICE_NAME]

As the [AGENT_ROLE] agent, help me with:
1. [SPECIFIC_TASK_1]
2. [SPECIFIC_TASK_2]
3. [SPECIFIC_TASK_3]

Consider microservices best practices:
- Service boundaries and responsibilities
- Inter-service communication patterns
- Data consistency strategies
- Deployment and scaling approaches

Technical Stack: [TECH_STACK]
Architecture Pattern: [PATTERN]
```

#### Legacy Modernization Template
```
You are the [AGENT_ROLE] agent working on legacy system modernization using Super Agents framework.

Legacy System Context:
- Technology: [LEGACY_TECH]
- Business Domain: [DOMAIN]
- Current Pain Points: [PAIN_POINTS]

Modernization Goals:
- [GOAL_1]
- [GOAL_2]
- [GOAL_3]

Please help me with [SPECIFIC_MODERNIZATION_TASK] while considering:
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Gradual migration approaches
- Business continuity requirements
- Modern architecture patterns
```

### Codeium-Specific Optimizations

#### Enhanced Code Completion Context

```javascript
// Add context comments for better Codeium completions
/**
 * Super Agents Framework Integration
 * Agent: Developer
 * Task: Implement user authentication service
 * Pattern: Microservices with JWT
 * Following sa-implement-story methodology
 */
class AuthenticationService {
  // Codeium will provide better completions with this context
}
```

#### Structured Comment Patterns

```javascript
// SA-Analyst: Market research shows OAuth2 is industry standard
// SA-Architect: Using JWT for stateless authentication
// SA-Developer: Implementing secure token handling
// SA-QA: Ensure comprehensive security testing

// This pattern helps Codeium understand the multi-agent context
```

## Configuration and Customization

### VS Code Configuration

```json
{
  "codeium.enableCodeLens": true,
  "codeium.enableChatProvider": true,
  "codeium.enableSearch": true,

## Integration Examples

### Example 1: API Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Requirements Analysis
# Use Codeium Chat with Analyst agent persona
"Acting as the Analyst agent, help me analyze requirements for a REST API that manages user subscriptions in a SaaS platform."

# 2. API Design
# Use Architect agent persona
"Acting as the Architect agent, design a RESTful API architecture for subscription management based on these requirements: [PASTE_REQUIREMENTS]"

# 3. Implementation Planning
# Use PM agent persona
"Acting as the PM agent, break down the API implementation into manageable tasks and create a development plan."

# 4. Code Implementation
# Use Developer agent persona + Codeium code completion
"Acting as the Developer agent, help me implement the subscription management endpoints. Start with the POST /subscriptions endpoint."

# 5. Testing Strategy
# Use QA agent persona
"Acting as the QA agent, create a comprehensive testing strategy for the subscription API, including unit tests, integration tests, and edge cases."
```

### Example 2: Frontend Component Development

```bash
# 1. UX Analysis
# Use UX Expert agent concepts through Analyst persona
"Acting as the Analyst agent with UX expertise, analyze user needs for a dashboard component that displays subscription analytics."

# 2. Component Architecture
# Use Architect agent persona
"Acting as the Architect agent, design a React component architecture for the subscription analytics dashboard."

# 3. Implementation

"Acting as the Developer agent, implement the SubscriptionDashboard component with responsive design and accessible features."

# 4. Quality Review
# Use QA agent persona
"Acting as the QA agent, review this React component for performance, accessibility, and code quality issues."
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Consistent Agent Context

```
# Always start with clear agent identification
"Acting as the [AGENT_NAME] agent from Super Agents framework..."

# Reference specific Super Agents tools when relevant
"Using the approach similar to sa-[TOOL_NAME]..."

# Maintain context across conversation
"Continue as the [AGENT_NAME] agent from our previous [CONTEXT]..."
```

### 2. Structured Prompt Patterns

```
# Template for complex requests
"Acting as [AGENT] agent:

Context: [CURRENT_SITUATION]
Goal: [DESIRED_OUTCOME]
Constraints: [LIMITATIONS]

Please help me:
1. [SPECIFIC_TASK_1]
2. [SPECIFIC_TASK_2]
3. [SPECIFIC_TASK_3]

Expected output: [FORMAT_EXPECTATION]"
```

### 3. Tool Integration References

```
# Reference Super Agents methodology
"Apply the Super Agents [WORKFLOW_NAME] workflow pattern to this problem"

# Mention specific tools for context
"This aligns with the sa-[TOOL_NAME] tool's approach in the Super Agents framework"
```

## Performance Optimization

### Efficient Prompting

```
# Concise but comprehensive prompts
"As Developer agent: Implement user auth in Node.js. Focus on security best practices. Provide code + tests."

# Context-aware requests
"Continue previous architecture discussion as Architect agent, now focusing on database schema design."
```

### Context Management

```
# Summarize previous context when needed
"Based on our previous PRD discussion as PM agent, now let's create implementation tasks as Developer agent."

# Reference specific outputs
"Using the architecture we designed earlier, implement the user service component."
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Agent Context Loss**:
   ```
   # Solution: Regularly reinforce agent persona
   "Confirming I'm working with you as the [AGENT_NAME] agent from Super Agents framework..."
   ```

2. **Inconsistent Responses**:
   ```
   # Solution: Use structured templates
   "As [AGENT] agent, following Super Agents methodology for [TASK_TYPE]..."
   ```

3. **Limited Codeium Context**:
   ```
   // Solution: Add context comments in code
   // Super Agents Framework - Developer Agent Implementation
   // Following sa-implement-story pattern
   ```

### Debug Techniques

```bash
# Validate agent understanding
"Confirm you understand your role as [AGENT_NAME] agent and list your key responsibilities."

# Test workflow comprehension
"Outline the Super Agents workflow for [PROJECT_TYPE] development."

# Verify tool awareness
"What Super Agents tools would you use for [SPECIFIC_TASK]?"
```

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

```
# Collaborative problem-solving
"Act as both Architect and Developer agents working together:
- Architect: Design the solution architecture
- Developer: Identify implementation challenges
- Together: Create a feasible implementation plan"
```

### Template-Driven Development

```
# Apply Super Agents templates
"Use the Super Agents [TEMPLATE_NAME] template to structure this solution"

# Reference existing patterns
"Apply the same pattern we used in the Super Agents [WORKFLOW_NAME] workflow"
```

### Automation Integration

```bash
# Combine CLI with Chat
sa workflow start --type=feature-development
# Then in Codeium Chat: "Help me implement the tasks from the started workflow"

# Task-driven development
sa task create --title="User Authentication" --agent=developer
# Then in Codeium Chat: "Acting as Developer agent, help me implement the User Authentication task"
```
