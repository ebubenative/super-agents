## Platform-Specific Adaptations

### ChatGPT Integration

```
# Custom GPT Instructions
You are a Super Agents Framework assistant with access to specialized agent personas:

1. When user requests analysis, switch to Analyst agent persona
2. When user requests planning, switch to PM agent persona  
3. When user requests architecture, switch to Architect agent persona
4. When user requests implementation, switch to Developer agent persona
5. When user requests review, switch to QA agent persona

Always start responses with: "SUPER AGENTS - [AGENT_NAME] AGENT"

Maintain context across conversations and reference appropriate Super Agents tools.
```

```

## Best Practices for Universal Integration

### 1. Consistent Persona Activation

```
# Always start with clear agent identification
"Activating [AGENT_NAME] agent from Super Agents Framework..."

# Reference framework context
"Using Super Agents methodology for [TASK_TYPE]..."

# Maintain agent context
"Continuing as [AGENT_NAME] agent from previous discussion..."
```

### 2. Structured Request Format

```
# Universal request template
"Super Agents Framework Request:

Agent: [AGENT_NAME]
Task: [SPECIFIC_TASK]
Context: [PROJECT_CONTEXT]
Requirements: [SPECIFIC_REQUIREMENTS]
Expected Output: [OUTPUT_FORMAT]

Please respond as the [AGENT_NAME] agent."
```

### 3. Cross-Platform Context Management

```
# Context preservation template
"Previous Context:
- Agent: [PREVIOUS_AGENT]
- Task: [PREVIOUS_TASK]  
- Output: [PREVIOUS_OUTPUT]

Current Request:
- Agent: [CURRENT_AGENT]
- Task: [CURRENT_TASK]
- Dependencies: [WHAT_FROM_PREVIOUS]"
```

### 4. Tool Reference Integration

```
# Reference Super Agents tools
"This aligns with the sa-[TOOL_NAME] tool approach in Super Agents"

# Suggest tool usage
"In the Super Agents framework, you would use sa-[TOOL_NAME] for this task"

# Workflow integration
"Following the Super Agents [WORKFLOW_NAME] workflow pattern"
```

## Advanced Integration Techniques

### Multi-Platform Coordination

```
# Session transfer template
"Transferring Super Agents session:

Previous Platform: [PLATFORM_NAME]
Agent Context: [AGENT_SUMMARY]
Project State: [CURRENT_STATE]
Next Tasks: [PENDING_TASKS]

Please continue as [AGENT_NAME] agent on this platform."
```

### Custom Tool Integration

```
# Generic tool implementation pattern
"Implementing Super Agents tool: sa-[TOOL_NAME]

Purpose: [TOOL_PURPOSE]
Input: [INPUT_FORMAT]
Process: [STEP_BY_STEP_PROCESS]  
Output: [OUTPUT_FORMAT]

Executing for current context..."
```

### Workflow Orchestration

```
# Multi-agent workflow coordination
"Super Agents Workflow: [WORKFLOW_NAME]
Phase: [CURRENT_PHASE]
Agent: [CURRENT_AGENT]

Previous Phase Output: [SUMMARY]
Current Phase Goal: [OBJECTIVE]
Next Phase Preview: [NEXT_STEPS]

Proceeding with [SPECIFIC_TASK]..."
```

## Platform Integration Examples

### Example 1: Web Development Project

```bash
# Analysis Phase (Any AI Platform)
"[PASTE_ANALYST_PERSONA]

Analyze market requirements for a project management web application targeting small businesses."

# Planning Phase
"[PASTE_PM_PERSONA]

Create PRD for project management app based on this analysis: [ANALYSIS_RESULTS]"

# Architecture Phase  
"[PASTE_ARCHITECT_PERSONA]

Design system architecture for project management SaaS based on: [PRD_SUMMARY]"

# Implementation Phase
"[PASTE_DEVELOPER_PERSONA]

Implement user authentication module based on architecture: [ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY]"

# QA Phase
"[PASTE_QA_PERSONA]

Review authentication implementation for security and quality: [CODE_IMPLEMENTATION]"
```

### Example 2: API Development

```bash
# Analysis
"[ANALYST_PERSONA] - Research API design patterns for e-commerce platforms"

# Planning
"[PM_PERSONA] - Create API specification based on research: [RESEARCH_RESULTS]"

# Architecture
"[ARCHITECT_PERSONA] - Design RESTful API architecture: [API_SPEC]"

# Implementation
"[DEVELOPER_PERSONA] - Implement product catalog endpoints: [ARCHITECTURE]"

# Quality Assurance
"[QA_PERSONA] - Review API implementation: [CODE_AND_TESTS]"
```

## Troubleshooting Universal Issues

### Common Problems and Solutions

1. **Agent Context Loss**:
   ```
   Solution: Re-establish context with persona re-activation
   "Re-activating [AGENT_NAME] agent with context: [CONTEXT_SUMMARY]"
   ```

2. **Workflow Discontinuity**:
   ```
   Solution: Use workflow state management
   "Super Agents Workflow State:
   - Completed: [COMPLETED_PHASES]
   - Current: [CURRENT_PHASE]  
   - Pending: [PENDING_PHASES]"
   ```

3. **Platform Limitations**:
   ```
   Solution: Adapt to platform constraints
   "Adapting Super Agents approach for [PLATFORM_NAME] limitations:
   - Constraint: [LIMITATION]
   - Adaptation: [WORKAROUND]"
   ```

### Debug and Validation

```bash
# Agent persona validation
"Validate current agent context:
- Agent: [EXPECTED_AGENT]
- Responsibilities: [LIST_RESPONSIBILITIES]
- Available Tools: [LIST_TOOLS]
- Current Task: [TASK_DESCRIPTION]"

# Workflow validation
"Validate workflow state:
- Workflow: [WORKFLOW_NAME]
- Phase: [CURRENT_PHASE]
