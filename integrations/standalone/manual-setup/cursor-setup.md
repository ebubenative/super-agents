# Super Agents - Cursor Manual Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive instructions for manually integrating Super Agents with Cursor IDE using the rules-based approach. This setup enables Super Agents personas and workflows within Cursor's AI assistant.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Cursor IDE**: Latest version installed
- **Node.js**: Version 18.0.0 or higher (for MCP integration, optional)
- **Git**: Version 2.0.0 or higher

### Verify Prerequisites
```bash
# Check Cursor installation
cursor --version

# Check Node.js version (optional)
node --version

# Check git version  
git --version
```

## Installation Methods

Choose one of the following installation methods:

### Method 1: Rules-Only Integration (Recommended)
- Uses Cursor's built-in rules system
- No external dependencies required
- Immediate setup and use

### Method 2: MCP + Rules Integration (Advanced)
- Combines MCP tools with rules
- Requires Node.js and Super Agents framework
- More powerful but complex setup

## Method 1: Rules-Only Integration

### Step 1: Install Super Agents Framework (Optional)

If you want access to templates and documentation:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/super-agents.git
cd super-agents

# No build required for rules-only setup
```

### Step 2: Create Cursor Rules Directory

Navigate to your project directory and create the rules structure:

```bash
# In your project root
mkdir -p .cursor/rules

# Create agents subdirectory (optional, for organization)
mkdir -p .cursor/rules/agents
```

### Step 3: Create Main Super Agents Rules File

Create `.cursor/rules/super-agents.md`:

```markdown
# Super Agents Framework Rules for Cursor

### Step 4: Create Individual Agent Rules (Optional)

For better organization, you can create individual agent files in `.cursor/rules/agents/`:

**`.cursor/rules/agents/analyst.md`**:
```markdown
# Business Analyst Agent Rules

Activate this persona when users need:
- Market research and analysis
- Competitive intelligence
- Business requirements gathering
- Strategic planning and recommendations

## Identity
You are a strategic business analyst with deep market intelligence expertise. You approach problems analytically and provide data-driven insights with clear business value.

## Communication Style

- Structured analysis with clear sections
- Evidence-based conclusions
- Actionable next steps

## Core Capabilities
- Market research and competitive analysis
- Business requirements documentation
- Stakeholder analysis and management
- ROI analysis and business case development
- Strategic planning and roadmap creation

## Response Structure
1. **Executive Summary**: Key findings and recommendations
2. **Analysis**: Detailed analysis with supporting data
3. **Recommendations**: Specific, actionable recommendations
4. **Next Steps**: Clear action items and timelines
5. **Assumptions**: Document key assumptions and dependencies
```

### Step 5: Configure Cursor Settings

Update your `.cursor/settings.json` (create if it doesn't exist):

```json
{
  "cursor.general.enableRules": true,
  "cursor.rules.customRulesPath": ".cursor/rules/super-agents.md",
  "cursor.rules.enableAgentRules": true,
  "super-agents.enabled": true,
  "super-agents.rulesPath": ".cursor/rules"
}
```

### Step 6: Test Rules Integration

#### Test Agent Activation
Open Cursor and test different agent personas:

1. **Test Analyst Agent**:
   ```
   I need help analyzing the competitive landscape for our new SaaS product. Can you help me understand our main competitors and their positioning?
   ```

2. **Test Architect Agent**:
   ```
   I need to design a scalable architecture for a multi-tenant e-commerce platform. What approach would you recommend?
   ```

3. **Test Developer Agent**:
   ```
   I need to implement a user authentication system with JWT tokens. Can you help me write the code?
   ```

#### Verify Agent Responses
Ensure that:
- Agents respond with appropriate personas
- Communication styles match agent definitions
- Responses include relevant capabilities and expertise
- Agents provide structured, actionable guidance

## Method 2: MCP + Rules Integration (Advanced)

### Step 1: Install Super Agents Framework

```bash
# Clone and install Super Agents
git clone https://github.com/your-org/super-agents.git
cd super-agents
npm install
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Setup MCP Integration

#### Check if Cursor Supports MCP
```bash
# Check Cursor version and MCP support
cursor --version
cursor --help | grep -i mcp
```

#### Configure MCP Server (if supported)
Create or update Cursor's MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "super-agents": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/super-agents/sa-engine/mcp-server/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SA_AGENTS_PATH": "/path/to/super-agents/sa-engine/agents",
        "SA_TEMPLATES_PATH": "/path/to/super-agents/sa-engine/templates"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Enhanced Rules with MCP Tools

Update your `.cursor/rules/super-agents.md` to include MCP tool references:

```markdown
# Super Agents Framework - Enhanced Rules with MCP Tools

## Available MCP Tools
When these tools are available through MCP integration:

### Core Tools
- `sa_initialize_project`: Initialize new projects
- `sa_list_tasks`: List and manage tasks
- `sa_get_task`: Get task details
- `sa_update_task_status`: Update task progress

### Agent-Specific Tools
- `sa_research_market`: Market research (Analyst)
- `sa_generate_prd`: Create PRDs (PM)
- `sa_design_system`: Architecture design (Architect)
- `sa_implement_story`: Code implementation (Developer)
- `sa_review_code`: Code reviews (QA)
- `sa_create_frontend_spec`: Frontend specs (UX Expert)

## Enhanced Agent Capabilities

When MCP tools are available, agents can:
1. Create and manage project tasks
2. Generate structured documents using templates
3. Access project-specific data and context
4. Maintain consistency across team workflows

## Usage Examples

### With MCP Tools Available
"Use sa_generate_prd to create a product requirements document for our new user authentication feature"

### Without MCP Tools
"Help me create a product requirements document for our new user authentication feature following PRD best practices"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Rules Not Loading

#### Check Rules File Syntax
```bash
# Verify markdown syntax
cursor .cursor/rules/super-agents.md

# Check for formatting issues
cat .cursor/rules/super-agents.md | head -20
```

#### Verify Settings Configuration
```bash
# Check settings file
cat .cursor/settings.json

# Ensure rules are enabled
grep -i rules .cursor/settings.json
```

### Agents Not Responding Correctly

#### Clear Response Patterns
- Make agent activation triggers more specific
- Ensure agent personas are clearly differentiated
- Add more explicit examples for each agent

#### Test Individual Agents
Test each agent separately to identify issues:
```
I need help with [specific agent task]. Please respond as the [agent name] agent.
```

### Performance Issues

#### Optimize Rules File Size
- Remove unused agent definitions
- Simplify complex rules
- Use references instead of duplication

#### Check Memory Usage
- Monitor Cursor's memory usage
- Restart Cursor if performance degrades
- Consider splitting rules into multiple files

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Agent Creation

Add project-specific agents to your rules:

```markdown
### DevOps Engineer (devops)
**Activate when**: User needs deployment, infrastructure, CI/CD, or operational concerns.

**Identity**: You are a DevOps engineer focused on reliable, scalable infrastructure and deployment processes.

**Capabilities**:
- Infrastructure as Code
- CI/CD pipeline design

```

### Workspace-Specific Rules

Create different rules for different projects:

```bash
# Project A
project-a/.cursor/rules/super-agents.md

# Project B  
project-b/.cursor/rules/super-agents.md
```

### Team Collaboration

Share rules across team members:

```bash
# Add rules to version control
git add .cursor/rules/
git commit -m "Add Super Agents rules configuration"
git push

# Team members can pull and use the same configuration
git pull
```

## Best Practices
