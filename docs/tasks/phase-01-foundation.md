- Setup CLI entry point and bin configuration
- Create command parsing and routing system

### Completion Details
- ✅ Installed and configured Commander.js v12.0.0
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive command structure:
  - `sa init` - Project initialization with templates
  - `sa config` - Configuration management (list, set, unset)
  - `sa agent` - Agent management (list, info, test)
  - `sa task` - Task management (list, show, create, update)
  - `sa plan` - Interactive planning sessions
  - `sa integrate` - IDE integration
  - `sa status` - Project status and statistics
  - `sa backup` - State backup/restore
- ✅ Setup CLI entry point at `/super-agents-cli/index.js`
- ✅ Configured bin in package.json as `"sa": "./super-agents-cli/index.js"`
- ✅ Created modular command routing with separate files for each command

---

## Task 3: Implement configuration system with YAML support and validation ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: High | **Status**: COMPLETED | **Completed**: 2025-07-28

### Requirements
- Create ConfigManager class for YAML configuration
- Implement configuration validation schema
- Setup hierarchical config loading (project > global > defaults)
- Add configuration migration system

### Completion Details
- ✅ Created ConfigManager class in `/sa-engine/config/ConfigManager.js`
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive Joi validation schema for all configuration options
- ✅ Setup hierarchical config loading:
  - Project level: `.super-agents/config.yaml`
  - Global level: `~/.super-agents/config.yaml` 
  - Defaults: Built-in default configuration
- ✅ Added configuration migration system for version compatibility
- ✅ Implemented YAML parsing with error handling
- ✅ Added dot-notation config access (e.g., `super_agents.ai.providers.primary`)

## Task 4: Build state management foundation with JSON persistence ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: High | **Status**: COMPLETED | **Completed**: 2025-07-28

### Requirements
- Create StateManager class for runtime state
- Implement workspace initialization (.super-agents/ directory)
- Setup state persistence with JSON files
- Create state backup and recovery mechanisms

### Completion Details
- ✅ Created StateManager class in `/sa-engine/state-manager/StateManager.js`

- ✅ Setup JSON state persistence in `.super-agents/state.json`
- ✅ Created comprehensive state structure:
  - Version tracking
  - Project metadata
  - Task management
  - Agent state
  - Workflow tracking
  - Session management
- ✅ Implemented state backup and recovery:
  - Automatic timestamped backups
  - Manual backup creation via CLI
  - State restoration from backup files
- ✅ Added atomic state updates with deep merging
- ✅ Implemented state validation and error handling

---

## Phase 1 Summary
