    instructions: |
      Ask 4 context questions (don't preview what happens next):
      1. What are we brainstorming about?
      2. Any constraints or parameters?
      3. Goal: broad exploration or focused ideation?
      4. Do you want a structured document output to reference later? (Default Yes)
    prompts:
      - type: input
        message: "What are we brainstorming about?"
        variable: brainstorming_topic

    description: "Let user choose brainstorming approach"
    instructions: |
      After getting answers to Step 1, present 4 approach options (numbered):
      1. User selects specific techniques
      2. Analyst recommends techniques based on context
      3. Random technique selection for creative variety
      4. Progressive technique flow (start broad, narrow down)
    prompts:
      - type: choice
        message: "Select your preferred brainstorming approach:"

    description: "Apply brainstorming techniques with continuous user engagement"
    instructions: |
      KEY PRINCIPLES:
      - FACILITATOR ROLE: Guide user to generate their own ideas through questions, prompts, and examples
      - CONTINUOUS ENGAGEMENT: Keep user engaged with chosen technique until they want to switch or are satisfied  
      - CAPTURE OUTPUT: If document output requested, capture all ideas generated in each technique section
      
      TECHNIQUE SELECTION:
      If user selected Option 1, present numbered list of techniques from brainstorming-techniques data.
      User can select by number.
    
    techniques:
      mind_mapping:
        name: "Mind Mapping"
        description: "Visual idea exploration with central topic and branching concepts"
        facilitation: "Start with central topic, ask for related concepts, build branches"
