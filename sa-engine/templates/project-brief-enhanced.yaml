    title: "Introduction"
    instruction: |
      This template guides creation of a comprehensive Project Brief that serves as the foundational input for product development.
      
      Start by asking the user which mode they prefer:
      
      1. **Interactive Mode** - Work through each section collaboratively
      2. **YOLO Mode** - Generate complete draft for review and refinement
      
      Before beginning, understand what inputs are available (brainstorming results, market research, competitive analysis, initial ideas) and gather project context.
